##About Our Brand

Nordstrom Rack is the off-price retail division of Nordstrom Inc., which was founded in 1901 in Seattle, Washington by John W. Nordstrom. Since then, Nordstrom has expanded from a small Seattle shoe shop to a leading fashion specialty retailer with over 100 stores and an e-commerce business that continues to grow and evolve. Nordstrom Rack has been serving customers for over 40 years, offering many of the same Nordstrom brands we know our customers love at great prices. And now that we are online, we hope we can serve you even better—giving you more ways to shop, wherever you may be.

##Why Shop the Rack?

Because we have the most current trends and the brands you love for 30-70% off original prices—each and every day. And because we're obsessed with finding new ways to help you shop the way you want to shop. It's all about serving customers on their terms: in store, online or through mobile and exciting flash sales powered by HauteLook. Whether you prefer the convenience of online shopping or crave the thrill of treasure hunting at one of our many stores, we've got you covered.
