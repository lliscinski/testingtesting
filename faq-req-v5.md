###ABOUT OUR SALE EVENTS

**How do HauteLook daily sale events work?**

Our team of experts partner with fashionable brands and approved suppliers to offer a wide assortment of styles and sizes at the best prices possible. When a sale event is complete, we work with our partner or supplier to fulfill the order. Once we receive the items from a partner or supplier, we then review, pack and ship them to our members.

We launch new events every day at 8AM Pacific. Events starting Monday – Thursday, including those launched in the afternoon and evenings, run for 48-72 hours. Events starting Friday or Saturday run until Monday morning. Home events launch every Tuesday at 1PM Pacific and run for a full 7 days.

In addition to our daily events, you can also shop Nordstrom Rack using the same shared account. We’ve made it easier than ever to shop our exciting events and an ongoing catalog of brands you love with just one checkout.

**How do I learn about HauteLook sale events?**

Every morning at 8AM Pacific, HauteLook members receive an email and/or mobile app alert listing the day’s new events. Simply click on the email or open your HauteLook mobile app to start shopping.

**What does it mean when an item is on hold?**

Each sale item has a set amount of inventory. An item is placed "On Hold" when the last available piece is put in another member's shopping cart but has not yet been purchased. Any item that has been in another member’s cart for over 15 minutes does become available again; so don’t lose hope if an item you love is on hold.

**How long can I have an item in my shopping cart?**

You may keep an item in your cart for 15 minutes. If an item times out but is still available, you can add it back to your cart by clicking "Add It Again." Items from nordstromrack.com will be reserved in your cart for up to 2 hours.
